Hi, I am Bob Zhao, currently working as an Assistant Professor/Lecturer at Anhui University, Hefei, CN. My interests mainly focus on System and Networking, including its theories,
algorithms, protocols and designs. 

Current Projects
======
**<font size=4>Instant Messaging system JIM</font>**  
I am developing a Java-based Instant Messaging system named JIM. Its backend is based on JMqtt and Spring Cloud microservice framework and its frontend is based on Paho and bootstrapVue.js. Contrast to Wildfire IM, this IM system is based on the MQTT Pub/Sub mechanism and is completely compatible to MQTT protocol, so it can be extended more naturally. JIM project is about to release. 

**<font size=4>Design of a Health Surveillance and Analysis Software System Based on Microservices</font>**  
This project is supported by Anhui Wuyudata Technology Co.Ltd. Based on microservice frameworks and video-based health indicator (heart rate, blood pressure etc.) detection algorithms, we are trying to build a non-contact health surveillance and analysis system and integrate a variety of technologies of multimedia, big data and machine learning to provide more accurate and comfortable health service.
