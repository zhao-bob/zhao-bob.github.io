Hi, I am Bob Zhao, currently working as an Assistant Professor/Lecturer at [Anhui University](https://www.ahu.edu.cn/), Hefei, CN. My interests mainly focus on System and Networking, including its theories,
algorithms, protocols and designs. 

Current Projects
======
**<font size=4>JIM: Java-based Instant Messaging system</font>**  
JIM is a Java-based Instant Messaging system. JIM server is based on [JMqtt](https://github.com/Cicizz/jmqtt) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and JIM client is based on [Eclipse Paho](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/) and [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/). Contrast to [Wildfire IM](https://github.com/wildfirechat/), JIM fully utilizes the [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) Pub/Sub mechanism and is completely compatible to [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) protocol, so it can be extended more flexible and naturally. JIM is about to release. 

**<font size=4>Design of a Health Surveillance and Analysis Software System Based on Microservices</font>**  
This project is supported by [Anhui Wuyudata Technology Co.Ltd.](http://www.wuyudata.cn/) Based on microservice frameworks and video-based health indicator (heart rate, blood pressure etc.) detection algorithms, we are trying to build a non-contact health surveillance and analysis system and integrate a variety of technologies of multimedia, big data and machine learning to provide more accurate and comfortable health service.
